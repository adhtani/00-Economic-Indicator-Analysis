## Do Corporate Tax Cuts Create more Jobs?  
  
**Statistical/Hypothetical Question **  
  
My Statistical Question for the project was Do tax cuts to corporate create jobs for the economy? This concept of trickle-down economics has been widely accepted since 1980â€™s.  I wanted to further analyze this and see if it creates jobs or does it have any relationship to the unemployment. If tax cuts create jobs, then the unemployment rates should go down as well indicating increased jobs. To create dataset for this project, I focused on only economic indicators and consolidated datasets by year to create dataset with multiple variables. For my hypothesis questions, I included Following Countries economic Indicators:
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, Chile, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, United Kingdom, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Turkey, USA, Slovenia, Slovakia.  
  
**Data Sources**  
Economic indicator: [OECD.org](https://stats.oecd.org/)  
   
   
**Modeling Appraoch**   
This Project was done with regression analysis.  

**Conclusion**
I did not find any relationship, if there was then it was negative relationship with r = -.220
